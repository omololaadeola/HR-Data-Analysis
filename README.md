HR Analytics Dashboard
AIM
The aim of this HR analytics dashboard is to understand the factors driving employee turnover and job satisfaction, and to develop strategies to improve retention and increase job satisfaction among workforce. The dashboard will focus on metrics such as total employees, male/female distribution, layoffs, promotions, job satisfaction, distance status, job level, and service year. By analyzing these metrics, the aim is to identify departments and employee groups with high turnover rates or low job satisfaction scores, and develop targeted interventions to improve retention and job satisfaction, ultimately leading to a more engaged and productive workforce.

Methodology:

Data Cleaning and Transformation:
The first step in creating this HR analytics dashboard was to clean and transform the raw data. This involved using Power Query in Power BI to clean and prepare the data, including generating conditional columns such as "Promotion", "Job Satisfaction", "Distance Status", "Layoffs", and "On Service". These conditional columns were created to provide insights into specific employee groups and will be used to filter and segment the data in the dashboard.

Identify KPIs:
Once the data was cleaned and transformed, we identified the key performance indicators (KPIs) that we wanted to track in the dashboard. These KPIs included "Total Employees", "Total Male", "Total Female", "Layoffs", and "On Service". These KPIs will help us track changes over time and identify trends in our workforce.

Visualization:
The next step was to create visualizations using the KPIs identified. We used column charts to visualize the data for "Promotion and Layoff by Department", "Employees by Job Satisfaction", "Distance Status", "Employees by Job Level", and "Employees by Service Year". These visualizations provide an overview of the data and enable us to identify trends and patterns.

Analysis:
Once the visualizations were created, we analyzed the data. This involved identifying areas where the KPIs were not meeting the desired targets, such as high layoff rates or low job satisfaction scores. By analyzing the data, we can identify the root causes of these issues and develop targeted interventions to improve employee outcomes.

Interventions:
Finally, based on the analysis of the data, we developed interventions to address the issues identified. For example, if the data shows that there is a low job satisfaction score among employees in a specific department, we might develop strategies to improve job satisfaction, such as offering more training and development opportunities or providing incentives for meeting performance goals. By implementing targeted interventions, we can improve employee outcomes and ultimately drive business success.
