HR Analytics Dashboard
AIM

The aim of this HR analytics dashboard is to understand the factors driving employee turnover and job satisfaction, and to develop strategies to improve retention and increase job satisfaction among workforce. The dashboard will focus on metrics such as total employees, male/female distribution, layoffs, promotions, job satisfaction, distance status, job level, and service year. By analyzing these metrics, the aim is to identify departments and employee groups with high turnover rates or low job satisfaction scores, and develop targeted interventions to improve retention and job satisfaction, ultimately leading to a more engaged and productive workforce.

METHODOLOGY:

Data Cleaning and Transformation:
The first step in creating this HR analytics dashboard was to clean and transform the raw data. This involved using Power Query in Power BI to clean and prepare the data, including generating conditional columns such as "Promotion", "Job Satisfaction", "Distance Status", "Layoffs", and "On Service". These conditional columns were created to provide insights into specific employee groups and will be used to filter and segment the data in the dashboard.

Identify KPIs:
Once the data was cleaned and transformed, we identified the key performance indicators (KPIs) that we wanted to track in the dashboard. These KPIs included "Total Employees", "Total Male", "Total Female", "Layoffs", and "On Service". These KPIs will help us track changes over time and identify trends in our workforce.

Visualization:
The next step was to create visualizations using the KPIs identified. We used column charts to visualize the data for "Promotion and Layoff by Department", "Employees by Job Satisfaction", "Distance Status", "Employees by Job Level", and "Employees by Service Year". These visualizations provide an overview of the data and enable us to identify trends and patterns.

Analysis:
Once the visualizations were created, we analyzed the data. This involved identifying areas where the KPIs were not meeting the desired targets, such as high layoff rates or low job satisfaction scores. By analyzing the data, we can identify the root causes of these issues and develop targeted interventions to improve employee outcomes.

Interventions:
Finally, based on the analysis of the data, we developed interventions to address the issues identified. For example, if the data shows that there is a low job satisfaction score among employees in a specific department, we might develop strategies to improve job satisfaction, such as offering more training and development opportunities or providing incentives for meeting performance goals. By implementing targeted interventions, we can improve employee outcomes and ultimately drive business success.


INSIGHTS

Layoffs: The data indicates that there are employees who will be laid off in the near future. It would be important for HR to communicate clearly with these employees and provide support during this difficult time. Additionally, HR may want to consider what impact these layoffs will have on the overall workforce and take steps to minimize disruption.

Job Satisfaction: The data shows that there are some employees who are not satisfied with their jobs. HR should explore the root causes of this dissatisfaction and develop strategies to address these issues. For example, they may want to consider offering more training and development opportunities or providing additional benefits to employees.

Distance Status: The data indicates that some employees work very far from the office, while others work very close. HR should consider whether this distance has any impact on employee productivity or job satisfaction. They may want to explore options for remote work or consider offering transportation benefits to employees who have long commutes.

Promotions: The data indicates that some employees are being considered for promotions. HR should ensure that these promotions are being awarded fairly and that all employees have equal opportunities for career advancement.

Gender: The data shows that there are more male employees than female employees. HR should consider whether this gender imbalance is having any impact on the workplace culture and take steps to promote greater diversity and inclusion.

Job Levels and Service Years: The data shows that there are employees at different job levels and with varying years of service. HR should consider whether these employees have different needs or face different challenges in the workplace. They may want to develop targeted interventions to address the needs of specific employee groups.

CONCLUSION
Based on the insights derived from the HR analytics dashboard, it is clear that there are several areas where HR can focus its efforts to improve employee outcomes and drive business success. First, HR should pay attention to the employees who are at risk of being laid off and ensure that they are being provided with adequate support. Additionally, HR should work to address issues related to job satisfaction and gender imbalance in the workforce. Finally, HR should consider the impact of distance status on employee productivity and job satisfaction, and develop strategies to address any challenges that employees may be facing in this regard.

By taking a data-driven approach to HR management and using tools like Power BI, organizations can gain valuable insights into their workforce and make informed decisions about how to optimize their human capital. With the right data and analytics tools, HR can identify opportunities for improvement and take targeted actions to drive business success.
